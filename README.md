# Zepto-SQL-Project
This repository contains a complete SQL data analysis project built from scratch using real-world data inspired by Zepto (an instant grocery delivery platform). The goal of the project is to demonstrate data analyst skills through data modeling, querying, and deriving business insights.

- Database Setup: Designed relational schema with tables for customers, orders, products, and deliveries.

- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Processed raw datasets, handled missing values, and ensured data integrity.

- SQL Analysis:
  - Sales trends by product category, location, and time.
  - Customer behavior: retention, churn, and cohort analysis.
  - Delivery performance: average time, peak hours, and bottlenecks.

- Insights & Recommendations: Identified top-selling products, optimized delivery patterns, and highlighted customer engagement strategies.
